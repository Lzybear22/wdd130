    <h2>Hunter Nesvold</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Hunter Nesvold. I am a Computer Science Major and I'm in my junior year at BYU-I. With my degree I hope to get into cloud computing working with AWS and Azure. 
        I was just married to my amazing wife Lizzie last november in the Idaho Falls temple.Some of my hobbies are playing guitar and going on walks with my wife and our new puppy.
        I'm currently working on a website using HTML and CSS hosted on AWS to showcase my resume and some projects I have worked on. So I am taking this class to help me with some ideas on how to style it.</p>
