      <h2>
        Audience: 
	Most of the audience of my website I believe will be recruiters or people in interviews looking for information about me.
  They will come to my website to see who I am. So basically, what school I went to and am going to what degree I’m pursuing and some projects I’ve worked on and am currently working on.
  There will be a page showing my resume and a page showcasing some projects I’ve done. This will be able to show off some skills I have learned while attending school and working on projects. Maybe in the future I will add what I have done while in the work force. 

Questions from website:
	I think some of the questions my audience will have is what I do and how I’ve done it.
  They will also be asking what kind of skills I have. So I will show off some projects I’ve worked on and maybe in the future show off the companies and teams I’ve worked for and in.
  Some other questions will be how I made the website and where to host it. I am going to host my website in the cloud on Amazon’s AWS.  

Showcasing projects:
	The most important thing of this site will be the projects and how I present them.
  They will have code that I’ve written, applications I’ve made, and other things I’ve worked on.
  Each one will have a picture or video of my project and a description of it. If I have a GitHub repository with that project, I will link that as well. I will also add more projects in the future.

About me page:
	I was thinking about adding a about me page to the project to show off my written resume and tell more about myself.
  I will show what school I am attending and when I am expecting to graduate. I will tell my major is and my minor. Also show off some certifications I have. 



Resume page:
	There will be a page where I can display my resume.
  This is to make it easy for recruiters to access without needing to go through email documents.
  This page will also have a summary of different skills I have with programming, databases, websites, or cloud projects I’ve worked on. 

Why chose this site?
	I’ve always been thinking about how I can show off more AWS projects and nothing seems better than hosting a website on AWS and have that show off even more projects.
  Also it shows that I can be a front end and back end developer. 
Future plans:
	In the future I will add projects that I have worked on during internships and positions from future jobs.
  It might be group projects that I have worked on and I will explain what I did and how I contributed to the project. This will help me explain and show how I work with teams and just by myself.
  Since AWS can be expensive I want to show that I think more about cost effectiveness. So hosting it on AWS I can show how I made this website cost effective.
