      <h2>
        Audience: 
	Most of the audience of my website I believe will be recruiters or people in interviews looking for information about me.
  They will come to my website to see who I am. So basically, what school I went to and am going to what degree I’m pursuing and some projects I’ve worked on and am currently working on.
  There will be a page showing my resume and a page showcasing some projects I’ve done. This will be able to show off some skills I have learned while attending school and working on projects. Maybe in the future I will add what I have done while in the work force. 

Questions from website:
	I think some of the questions my audience will have is what I do and how I’ve done it.
  They will also be asking what kind of skills I have. So I will show off some projects I’ve worked on and maybe in the future show off the companies and teams I’ve worked for and in.
  Some other questions will be how I made the website and where to host it. I am going to host my website in the cloud on Amazon’s AWS.  

Showcasing projects:
	The most important thing of this site will be the projects and how I present them.
  They will have code that I’ve written, applications I’ve made, and other things I’ve worked on.
  Each one will have a picture or video of my project and a description of it. If I have a GitHub repository with that project, I will link that as well. I will also add more projects in the future.

About me page:
	I was thinking about adding a about me page to the project to show off my written resume and tell more about myself.
  I will show what school I am attending and when I am expecting to graduate. I will tell my major is and my minor. Also show off some certifications I have. 



Resume page:
	There will be a page where I can display my resume.
  This is to make it easy for recruiters to access without needing to go through email documents.
  This page will also have a summary of different skills I have with programming, databases, websites, or cloud projects I’ve worked on. 

Why chose this site?
	I’ve always been thinking about how I can show off more AWS projects and nothing seems better than hosting a website on AWS and have that show off even more projects.
  Also it shows that I can be a front end and back end developer. 
Future plans:
	In the future I will add projects that I have worked on during internships and positions from future jobs.
  It might be group projects that I have worked on and I will explain what I did and how I contributed to the project. This will help me explain and show how I work with teams and just by myself.
  Since AWS can be expensive I want to show that I think more about cost effectiveness. So hosting it on AWS I can show how I made this website cost effective.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my protfolio site. I am a student at BYU-I majoring in Computer Science. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="pictures/Hunters projects.png" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p>
        Here is my SQL Expense Tracker. This project I used Python and SQL to make a program that allows you to add expenses to a database and veiw them. You can have diffrent users add expenses to 
        diffrent tables. Then you can press view all expenses and you can see all of the inputs by every user. Each user can only add and delete from their own tables by can see everyones. I want to 
        make a few changes in the future to add more security such as passwords to make sure you can not just input the users name and be able to make changes to their table.

      </ul>
      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <p>
        Here is my Weather App I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This program uses a API from OPENWEATHERAPI.org to use their data to allow users to view the weather in diffrent cities all over the United States.
        This uses Javascript to make use of the api and to make the website look pretty and flashy so users enjoy their experience.

        This page will have pictures of the project in use and under them what is happening with the program under the picture. I will explain what the app does and how I use it. Then I will add 
        a link to my github for the program so people can copy it and use it for themselves.

      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <p>         
        The same as project 1 there will be pictures of the app in use and I will explain how the app works. The first picture will be a picture of the start of the app. The second picture will be the 
        app in use and show how it takes data to show the weather in the city you provided. There will be a discription of how the app works and what api I used.
